						Hi there! I'm Michelle üëã

					<p className="my-2">
						I‚Äôm a front end developer who builds apps that look and feel
						beautiful. I strive to deliver products that have a terrific user
						experience, are responsive, and are accessible to as many people as
						possible while also delivering clean and reusable code.
					</p>

					<p className="my-2">
						Prior to transitioning into software development, I studied life
						sciences at the University of Toronto. I leverage my research and
						analytical skills to thoughtfully decompose problems and deal with
						any ambiguity along the way. I value myself as a lifelong learner
						who loves a challenge and thrives in both individual and group
						settings. I'm looking to bring my positivity, creativity, and
						resourcefulness to the right team!

						When I'm not coding, you can find me drawing, trying new cafes, or
						browsing all the newest animal videos üêæ
